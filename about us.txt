<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color:#fe8503 ;font-size: 15px"><br>Who we are?</span><br><br>The
 Indian Paper Industry is among the top 15 global players today, with an
 output of more than 6 millions tones annually. Paper Industry in India 
is riding on a strong demand and on an expanding mood to meet the 
projected demand of 8 million tons by 2010 &amp; 13 million tons by 
2020. <br><br>Demand for paper as well as paper board has increased 
considerably since independence thus resulting in the set up of a few 
major paper mills across the country. One of the major players who 
dominate the paper industry in the Indian sector is Khanna &nbsp;Paper 
Mills Private Limited. <br><br>Khanna Paper Mills Private Limited, is an
 ISO 9001:2000 certified company, manufacturing quality paper and board 
by recycling of waste paper as the feedstock &nbsp;for domestic 
consumption for a little over 4 decades. &nbsp;Although paper is 
traditionally identified with reading and writing, communication has now
 been replaced by packaging as the single largest category of paper use 
at 41% of all paper used. Khanna Paper Mills is the largest paper mill 
production house of its kind and is among the top ten in paper 
production in India.<br><br>Khanna today produces around 3,30,000 MT of 
board and writing and printing paper. Khanna has also become the first 
paper mill in India to produce high quality writing and 
printing&nbsp;board&nbsp;from 100% deinked woodfree recovered paper. 
Khanna Paper Mills distribution network of 100+ dealers has a reach not 
only over the length and breadth of India but across the globe with a 
focus on demand markets and exporting their products to the SAARC 
countries, Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color:#fe8503 ;font-size: 15px">Infrastructure </span><br><br>Khanna
 Paper Mills believs that the workspace plays a very major role in the 
productivity of an employee therefore the campus has a unique state-of- 
the- art infrastructure well equipped with the latest technology. The 
sprawling 100 acre Khanna Paper Mills campus houses:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;" type="disc">
<li>Two plants that produce Board with a daily capacity of 400 tons</li>
<li>A plant that produces Newsprint with a daily capacity of 400 Tons</li>
<li>A plant that produces writing and printing paper with daily capacity of 400 Tons</li>
<li>Two plants that produce pulp by recycling of waste paper with a daily production capacity of 350 Tons</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color:#fe8503 ;font-size: 15px">Going Greener</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Industrialized paper making has an effect 
on the environment both upstream (where raw materials are acquired and 
processed) and downstream (waste-disposal impacts). Recycling paper 
reduces this impact. Factually recycling 1 ton of newsprint saves about 1
 ton of wood while recycling 1 ton of printing or copier paper saves 
slightly more than 2 tons of wood. &nbsp;<br><br>Khanna Paper Mills "<strong>GO GREEN</strong>"
 initiative is a major breakthrough in the paper producing industry and 
Khanna Paper Mills feels proud to have introduced this initiative. Using
 recycled&nbsp; waste paper as the feedstock, Khanna Paper&nbsp;has 
revolutionized the Paper industry, thus gaining a heads up as a 
environment friendly organization, which strongly believes and practices
 saving and retaining the earthly glory of our planet.<br><br><span ><span style="color:#fe8503 ;font-size: 15px">USA Operations</span></span><br><br><strong>Khanna Paper?s</strong>
 presence in USA strategically enables it to procure high quality 
recycle fiber from around the world. They procure 4,20,000 MT of waste 
paper annually through collaborative network of partners around the 
world for sourcing waste paper. The enduring relationships and contracts
 ensure cost and operational efficiency leading to long term 
sustainability.<strong></strong></p>

 Indian Paper Industry is among the top 15 global players today, with an
 output of more than 6 millions tones annually. Paper Industry in India 
is riding on a strong demand and on an expanding mood to meet the 
projected demand of 8 million tons by 2010 &amp; 13 million tons by 
2020. <br><br>Demand for paper as well as paper board has increased 
considerably since independence thus resulting in the set up of a few 
major paper mills across the country. One of the major players who 
dominate the paper industry in the Indian sector is Khanna &nbsp;Paper 
Mills Private Limited. <br><br>Khanna Paper Mills Private Limited, is an
 ISO 9001:2000 certified company, manufacturing quality paper and board 
by recycling of waste paper as the feedstock &nbsp;for domestic 
consumption for a little over 4 decades. &nbsp;Although paper is 
traditionally identified with reading and writing, communication has now
 been replaced by packaging as the single largest category of paper use 
at 41% of all paper used. Khanna Paper Mills is the largest paper mill 
production house of its kind and is among the top ten in paper 
production in India.<br><br>Khanna today produces around 3,30,000 MT of 
board and writing and printing paper. Khanna has also become the first 
paper mill in India to produce high quality writing and 
printing&nbsp;board&nbsp;from 100% deinked woodfree recovered paper. 
Khanna Paper Mills distribution network of 100+ dealers has a reach not 
only over the length and breadth of India but across the globe with a 
focus on demand markets and exporting their products to the SAARC 
countries, Africa and the Middle East.</p>

 Paper Mills believs that the workspace plays a very major role in the 
productivity of an employee therefore the campus has a unique state-of- 
the- art infrastructure well equipped with the latest technology. The 
sprawling 100 acre Khanna Paper Mills campus houses:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;" type="disc">
<li>Two plants that produce Board with a daily capacity of 400 tons</li>
<li>A plant that produces Newsprint with a daily capacity of 400 Tons</li>
<li>A plant that produces writing and printing paper with daily capacity of 400 Tons</li>
<li>Two plants that produce pulp by recycling of waste paper with a daily production capacity of 350 Tons</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color:#fe8503 ;font-size: 15px">Going Greener</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Industrialized paper making has an effect 
on the environment both upstream (where raw materials are acquired and 
processed) and downstream (waste-disposal impacts). Recycling paper 
reduces this impact. Factually recycling 1 ton of newsprint saves about 1
 ton of wood while recycling 1 ton of printing or copier paper saves 
slightly more than 2 tons of wood. &nbsp;<br><br>Khanna Paper Mills "<strong>GO GREEN</strong>"
 initiative is a major breakthrough in the paper producing industry and 
Khanna Paper Mills feels proud to have introduced this initiative. Using
 recycled&nbsp; waste paper as the feedstock, Khanna Paper&nbsp;has 
revolutionized the Paper industry, thus gaining a heads up as a 
environment friendly organization, which strongly believes and practices
 saving and retaining the earthly glory of our planet.<br><br><span ><span style="color:#fe8503 ;font-size: 15px">USA Operations</span></span><br><br><strong>Khanna Paper?s</strong>
 presence in USA strategically enables it to procure high quality 
recycle fiber from around the world. They procure 4,20,000 MT of waste 
paper annually through collaborative network of partners around the 
world for sourcing waste paper. The enduring relationships and contracts
 ensure cost and operational efficiency leading to long term 
sustainability.<strong></strong></p>
